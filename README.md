Reading:  Hmwrk 3 and beyond:
- MIT OCW Lectures:  6, 7, 8, 9
- Chp. 2 diodes in Circuits by UMF textbook
- Chp. 3 BJT inverter in Circuits by UMF textbook.
- Chp. 4 MOS inverter in Circuits by UMF textbook
- MIT textbook:  Nonlinear, diodes, transistors.
- Spice – voltage controlled switch (relay)Writing:
1.Describe 4 types of transistors.
2. Describe the spice model of a voltage controlled switch.
3.  Describe several types of transistor divider circuits.
4.  Describe and abstract a Morse telegraph repeater circuit.
5.  Describe the operation of an electret microphone circuit.
6.   Spice cmos gate代 写ECE3020 Homework 3R
代做程序编程语言 example.
6a.  Add a DC sweep and show your result.
6b.  Replace the pmos with a resistor and show and comment on the new DC sweep with regards to noise margins and gain.
6c.   Replace the nmos with a resistor and show and comment on the new DC sweep with regards to noise margins and gain.
7.  Exercise the switch with 2 resistor divider circuits to show the different DC sweep behaviors for the resistor pull up and pull down cases.   In the resistor pull down case, demonstrate both the 4 terminal and 3 terminal switch cases and discuss how these are related to transistor divider circuit insights.
